# Clustering in R
Clustering for Outlier Analysis using Gowers Distance.-
Used dissimilarities or distances between objects, defined by a distance metric. Gowers Distance was chosen because the standard k-means algorithm isn't directly applicable to categorical data.- Sample space for categorical data is discrete, and doesn't have a natural origin. A Euclidean distance function  from K means on such a space isn't really meaningful.
